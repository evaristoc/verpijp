          <h5><u><i>What?</i></u></h5>
          <p>This proof-of-concept sketches a browsing alternative through collections of historical images of De Pijp, geocoded at the approximated locations where the images were taken. Current source is <i>Stadarchief Amsterdam</i> API. The resulting demo site is part of a broader personal project: <i>De Pijp Experiment</i> - proof-of-concept sites focused on solutions/alternatives for De Pijp neighborhood by De Pijp neighbors.</p>
          
          <h5><u><i>Why?</i></u></h5>
          <p>People trend to create stronger bonds to places for which they know its history and its subculture. The goal of this concept is to help neighbors and visitors to create that bond to De Pijp neighbourhood through old images. It takes inspiration from diferent directions:
          <ul>
              <li>My kid, who for some time showed an special interest in history</li>
              <li>Some enthusiastic neighbors who have been sharing with me details of the history of De Pijp and Amsterdam</li>
              <li>Previous initiatives: www.oldsf.org and its Amsterdam clone, www.oudams.nl; London Museum's StreetMuseum and its Dutch counterpart, Street Museum NL (onh.nl); "Verbeelding aan de Amstel" Exhibition; others</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          
          <h5><u><i>For Who?</i></u></h5>
          <p>The project tests a light tool destinated to the general public, no matter the background, who want to inmerse into the historical context of the neighborhood. It could be also thought as a tool for students and those in the educative sector.</p>
