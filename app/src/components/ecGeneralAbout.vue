          <h5><u><i>What</i></u></h5>
          <p>OldDePijp is an open-source map tool that provides browsing of historic De Pijp images.
This tool maps around 1,000 images from De Pijp dating back to 1850.</p>

        <p>This tool replicates many features of an on-going project already implemented for other cities (<a href="http://www.oldsf.org/#">OldSF</a>, <a href="https://www.oldnyc.org/#">OldNYC</a>, <a href="https://oldto.sidewalklabs.com/#">OldTO</a>), all authored by <a href="https://twitter.com/danvdk">Dan Vanderkamp</a>. Another inspiring project was <a href="https://www.oldams.nl/">OldAms</a>, which also took inspiration from the Vanderkamp's projects.</p>
        <p>However, instead of stop by being a geolocated catalogue of images as the cited projects, this one seeks to offer a playful educative outdoor experience. Some things that you will notice in this tool that are not currently offered by its benchmarks are:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>The geolocation of the images are <i>the approximate position from where the image was taken</i> instead of the address they refer to - so the user can see the old image's subject from the correct position.</li>
                <li>As added feature, the user can overlay old images on the current subject using a mobile camera while in the right location, to enjoy a "before and after" experience.</li>
                <li>This project also includes historical details of De Pijp, trying to add another informative level than its counterparts.</li>
                <li>Finally, it also includes some games intended to the people who want to explore more by looking for "missing details" around.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Images are shown as they are, without correction. This is an intentional invitation to also explore the details of the original old image.</p>
        <!--<p>The goal is to help De Pijp visitors and residents discover something new about this neighbourhood, by providing a powerful way to visualize the changes that have taken place over time.</p>

        For example, on the left is a current photo of Yonge Street at Temperance. We can see the historic Dineen building and its ground-floor coffee shop. We also see four lanes of car traffic, with some road work taking place and a notable lack of pedestrian activity.

        On the right is a photo from the same corner circa 1903. We see the Dineen building in its original glory as a fur company. We see a streetcar heading our way but no private cars, which hadn’t yet been adopted en masse. We also see lots of sidewalk activity outside a diverse and inviting array of building facades and shop awnings.-->
          
          <h5><u><i>Why</i></u></h5>
          <p>People trend to create stronger bonds to places for which they know its history and its subculture. The goal of this concept is to help neighbors and visitors to create that bond to De Pijp neighbourhood through old images.</p>
          
          
          <h4 style="margin: 30px 20px;"><u>FAQ</u></h4>

          <h5><u><i>For Who</i></u></h5>
          <p>The project tests a light tool destinated to the general public, no matter the background, who want to inmerse into the historical context of the neighborhood. It could be also thought as a tool for students and those in the educative sector.</p>

          <h5><u><i>Resources</i></u></h5>
          <p>The project makes use of different online public resources, including but not exclusively: Postcards from De Pijp Facebook group; Amsterdam Archief; Flickr; Pinterest; etc. A full list of resources can be found <a href="">here</a></p>
          <p>The creator of OldDePijp did not collect or digitize any of these images — credit for that massive undertaking belongs entirely to the corresponding indiviuals and organizations.</p>
          <p>Currently, clicking on a photo pulls up the information curated by the author of this tool. The information might come from the same source where the image was taken, another source, or from personal fieldwork.</p>
          <p>TODO: photographers, etc.</p>
          <p>There is no affiliation whatsoever with any of those individuals / organisations.</p>
          
          <h5><u><i>Geocoding</i></u></h5>         
          <p>The approach in this project is different to benchmark projects (the OldXX series) - instead of geocoding based on address, the author tried to find <i>the place from where the image was taken</i>. The geocoding has been done largely manually, based on previous knowledge of the area, use of internet mapping tools like Google Maps, and field visits.</p>
          <p>The reason for that is the nature of this project, which is intended as OUTDOOR exploration of the area and a more immersive approach than the prescedent projects.</p>
          <p>Despite of the efforts the geocoding is likely not perfect. Many changes in landscape, streets and premises will certainly make difficult to determine the correct location. If you see an incorrect address in the collection, please email us.</p>
          
          <h5><u><i>Copyrights</i></u></h5>
          <p>This project gave priority to images whose copyright is in the public domain, which means permission is not required for reuse. In all cases though the copyright information is shown with the image entry or a label.</p>

          <h5><u><i>Added Features</i></u></h5>
          <p>Apart of being used as a catalogue, you can go to De Pijp, find the location where the image points to, and look around to find the subject of the image from there. Then you can either:</p>
          <ul>
                <li>Manually overlap the image to the current location, for a taste of "before and after" impression.</li>
                <li>At some locations you might read some historical details about De Pijp and personalities that influenced it.</li>
                <li>Some locations are linked to a "treasure search" in the surrounding area (usually around 100mts radius).</li>
          </ul>

           <h5><u><i>Want to Contribute</i></u></h5>
           There are several ways you can contribute: as developer, you can help with spotting/correcting issues, suggesting features or even improving the existing project. If you are historian or similar, we would like to know more about the content we have created. Also as user, if you see an error, eg. a wrong geolocation that should be corrected, please let us know.</p>
 
          <h5><u><i>Data Collected from Users</i></u></h5>
          <p>To help gauge usage, the tool records anonymous information about which photos people look at. We don’t tie that information to individuals. If users submit feedback, we use it for the limited purpose of improving the tool, and at times for responding to inquiries. Personal information collected as part of OldDePijp is governed by <a href="">this privacy policy</a>.</p>
